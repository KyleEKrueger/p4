There are some inconsistent behavior in my program. And there are some functionalities that were not able to be completed.
For example, input does not change the file to arguments, but rather it opens the file and tries to run the contents as commands.
>, cd, >&, !! should work as intended
I wrote this code myself, however I used a few resources for reading on how functionalities of certain commands work
